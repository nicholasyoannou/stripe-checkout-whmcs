Stripe Checkout for WHMCS
</h1>
<p align="center">
A simple Stripe Checkout for WHMCS using FastAPI, and simple WHMCS forwarding logic.
</p>

## Information
Stripe's checkout system allows use of their fraud protection system (if the Stripe account is eligible) allowing, if a customer chargebacks, no chargeback fees up to $25,000 (as far as I'm aware). To be eligible for Stripe's Chargeback Protection Program, payments need to be processed through Stripe's Checkout page infrastructure, hence this plugin.

## How this plugin works
Quite simply, on checkout (via WHMCS) as soon as the user submits to pay:
- the user email, invoice number, and amount is submitted (POST) via form data to FastAPI
- request is processed and a series of checks is conducted to check that the purchase is valid
- if checks are correct, a Stripe Checkout payment URL is generated by making a POST request to Stripes API using the Stripe account secret key
- Redis then (temporarily) stores a link between the Stripe Checkout URL, and the WHMCS invoice ID which is involved in later checks (expires slightly longer than 30 mins to account for 3D Secure and other scenarios)
- FastAPI redirects the user to the Stripe Checkout payment page, where the user pays (user has 30 mins to pay otherwise link expires)
- After payment, the user is redirected back to the FastAPI (via a GET request) site which directly checks if the invoice has been paid via Stripe, and the invoice has been paid within the last 30 minutes
- if the invoice has been paid, a payment will be added to the invoice with the transaction ID of the Stripe invoice

This following is required:
- WHMCS installation with administrator access (in order to create API credentials)
- A VPS/instance able to host a Python3 program of FastAPI, which is publicly exposable (does not matter on port but ports 443/80 recommended)
- A Redis instance (can be self-hosted (for best security and performance, on same instance as FastAPI) or using free services like [Upstash](https://upstash.com/))

Optional prerequisites:
- NGINX/Apache, if on VPS/dedicated, to reverse proxy
